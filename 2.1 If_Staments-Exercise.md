## Hands-on Exercise  
   
In this exercise, you'll practice using If Statements in Terraform to dynamically configure Azure resources based on specified conditions.  
   
### Prerequisites  
   
- An Azure account  
- Terraform installed on your local machine  
   
### Exercise Steps  
   
1. Create a new file called `main.tf` and add the following code:  
   
```terraform  
provider "azurerm" {  
  features {}  
}  

variable "environment" {  
  description = "Deployment environment"  
  default     = "dev"  
} 

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {  
  name     = "example-resources"  
  location = "West Europe"  
}  
  
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {  
  name                = "example-network"  
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name  
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location  
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]  
}  
  
resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {  
  name                 = "internal"  
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name  
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name  
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]  
}  
  
resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {  
  name                = "example-nic"  
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location  
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name  
  
  ip_configuration {  
    name                          = "internal"  
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.example.id  
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"  
  }  
}  
```  
   
In this example, the VM size will be "Standard_D2s_v3" if the `environment` variable is set to "prod". If it is not, the VM size will be "Standard_B1ms".  
   
2. Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:  
   
```bash  
terraform init  
terraform apply  
```  
   
When asked for a value for variable "environment", try inputting different values and observe the change in the VM size.  
   
### Conclusion  
   
By completing this exercise, you should now understand how to use If Statements (Conditional Expressions) in Terraform to dynamically configure your Azure resources based on certain conditions. This ability is crucial in creating flexible and scalable Terraform code.
