# LOOPS Hands-on Exercise  
  
In this exercise, you'll practice creating multiple Azure Virtual Networks using both `count` and `for_each` loops.   
  
## Prerequisites  
  
- An Azure account  
- Terraform installed on your local machine  

**Please note that you need to replace `"exampleResourceGroup"` with the name of an existing resource group in your Azure account.**
  
## Count Loop Exercise  
  
1. Create a new file called `main.tf` and add the following code:  
  

```
provider "azurerm" {  
    features {}  
}  

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {  
    count               = 3  
    name                = "exampleVNet${count.index}"  
    location            = "West US"  
    resource_group_name = "exampleResourceGroup"  
    address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]  
}  
```
In this example, Terraform will create three Azure Virtual Networks with the same location and similar names.

2. Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:
```
terraform init  
terraform apply  
```
## For_each Loop Exercise
 
1. Modify your main.tf file to use the for_each loop:

```
provider "azurerm" {  
    features {}  
}  

variable "vnet_names" {  
    default = {  
        vnet1 = "West US"  
        vnet2 = "East US"  
    }  
}  

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {  
    for_each            = var.vnet_names  
    name                = each.key  
    location            = each.value  
    resource_group_name = "exampleResourceGroup"  
    address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]  
}  
```
In this example, Terraform will create an Azure Virtual Network for each entry in the vnet_names map with the respective location.

2. Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:
```
terraform init  
terraform apply  
```

## Conclusion
 
By completing this exercise, you should now understand the differences between the count and for_each loops in Terraform and when to use each one.
