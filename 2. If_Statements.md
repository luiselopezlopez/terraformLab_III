# Terraform If Statements  
   
Terraform If Statements, also known as Conditional Expressions, allow for dynamic configuration based on specified conditions. They provide a way to define different behaviors in your Terraform code based on input variables or computed values.  
   
## Understanding If Statements in Terraform  
   
An If Statement in Terraform is a conditional expression that uses the syntax `condition ? true_val : false_val`. If the condition is `true`, it will return the `true_val`. If the condition is `false`, it will return the `false_val`.   
  
## Terraform If Statement Examples for Azure  
   
The following examples will help you understand how to use If Statements in Terraform with Azure:  
   
**Example 1: Changing the Size of an Azure VM Based on an Environment Variable**  
   
```terraform  
provider "azurerm" {  
  features {}  
}  
   
variable "environment" {  
  description = "Deployment environment"  
  default     = "dev"  
}  
   
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {  
  name                  = "exampleVM"  
  location              = "West US"  
  resource_group_name   = "exampleResourceGroup"  
  
  # Use a smaller VM size in dev, larger in prod  
  vm_size = var.environment == "prod" ? "Standard_D2s_v3" : "Standard_B1ms"  
  #...  
}  
```  
   
In this example, the VM size will be "Standard_D2s_v3" if the `environment` variable is set to "prod". If it is not, the VM size will be "Standard_B1ms".  
   
**Example 2: Conditional Creation of an Azure Resource**  
   
```terraform  
provider "azurerm" {  
  features {}  
}  
   
variable "create_public_ip" {  
  description = "Determines whether a Public IP should be created"  
  default     = false  
}  
   
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "example" {  
  count               = var.create_public_ip ? 1 : 0  
  name                = "examplePublicIP"  
  location            = "West US"  
  resource_group_name = "exampleResourceGroup"  
  allocation_method   = "Dynamic"  
}  
```  
   
In this example, a Public IP will be created if the `create_public_ip` variable is set to `true`. If it is `false`, no Public IP will be created.  
   

## Pitfalls

Conditional expressions, also known as If Statements in Terraform, are very useful for making configuration decisions based on variable values. However, they come with some pitfalls you should be aware of:  
   
1. **Complexity**: Overusing conditional expressions can lead to complex and hard-to-read code, making it difficult for others (or future you) to understand. Keep your conditionals simple and clear.  
   
2. **Type Consistency**: The true and false result expressions must be the same type. Terraform will return a type mismatch error if they are not the same.  
   
```terraform  
output "instance_type" {  
  value = var.environment == "prod" ? "Standard_D2s_v3" : 10  
}  
```  
In the above example, Terraform will return a type mismatch error as "Standard_D2s_v3" is a string and 10 is an integer.  
   
3. **Boolean Evaluation**: Conditional expressions in Terraform use strict boolean evaluation, meaning the condition part of the expression must be either true or false. Any other values will result in an error.  
   
4. **Resource Existence**: A common mistake is to use a conditional expression to control whether a resource is created, by using it in the resource's arguments. However, even if the condition is false, Terraform still evaluates the entire resource block, so any references to that resource elsewhere in your code will cause errors.  
   
```terraform  
resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "vm" {  
  count = var.create_vm ? 1 : 0  
  #...  
}  
   
output "vm_id" {  
  value = azurerm_virtual_machine.vm.id  
}  
```  
   
In the above example, if `var.create_vm` is false, Terraform will still evaluate the output, causing an error because the VM does not exist.  
   
To mitigate this, you can also use a conditional expression in the output:  
   
```terraform  
output "vm_id" {  
  value = var.create_vm ? azurerm_virtual_machine.vm[0].id : "No VM Created"  
}  
```  
   
5. **Order of Evaluation**: Conditional expressions are evaluated immediately, not lazily. This means that both the true and false branches are checked for errors even if they won't be executed, potentially causing unexpected error messages.  
   

## Conclusion  
   
Terraform If Statements (Conditional Expressions) are a powerful tool for managing dynamic infrastructure. They allow you to adapt your infrastructure based on conditions, making your Terraform code more flexible and scalable.
