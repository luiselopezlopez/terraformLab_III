# Terraform Loops

[Home](README.md)

Terraform loops are powerful tools used to manage similar resources without having to duplicate code. They play a crucial role in making the infrastructure code more manageable, readable, and easier to maintain. Terraform provides two primary ways to create loops: count and for_each.
## Understanding Loops in Terraform
 
A loop in Terraform is a way to perform the same task multiple times without duplicating code. This repetition is useful when you need to create a group of similar resources.
## Count Loop
 
The count parameter allows you to create a fixed number of similar resources. The count value represents the number of iterations, and each iteration creates a new instance of the resource.

Example:

    provider "azurerm" {  
      features {}  
    }  
    
    resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {  
        count    = 3  
        name     = "exampleResourceGroup${count.index}"  
        location = "West US"  
    }  
 
In this example, Terraform will create three Azure Resource Groups with the same location and similar names.
## For_each Loop
 
The for_each loop in Terraform creates a set of resources based on a set or map. Unlike count, for_each creates resources with a more meaningful name and does not recreate resources when the order changes.

Example:

    provider "azurerm" {  
        features {}  
    }  
    
    variable "rg_names" {  
        default = {  
            rg1 = "West US"  
            rg2 = "East US"  
        }  
    }  
    
    resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {  
        for_each = var.rg_names  
        
        name     = each.key  
        location = each.value  
    }  
 
In this example, Terraform will create an Azure Resource Group for each entry in the rg_names map with the respective location.
Common Pitfalls
 
While loops are powerful, they can also introduce complexity into your Terraform code. For instance, changing the order or removing an element from the middle of a count list can cause unintended resource destruction and recreation. On the other hand, for_each does not have this problem but requires a set or map, which may not always be convenient to provide.

## Pitfalls

Terraform loops, using `count` or `for_each`, are powerful tools for creating multiple resource instances or iterating over collections. However, there are several pitfalls that can create confusion or cause unexpected behavior:  
   
1. **Order sensitivity with `count`**: In Terraform, `count` creates resources in a zero-based index order. If you remove an item from the middle of the list, Terraform will destroy and recreate resources to maintain the order. This can lead to unintended resource destruction. To avoid this, use `for_each` with a set or map, which is not order-sensitive.  
   
2. **Changing `count` or `for_each` value type**: If you switch from `count` to `for_each`, or vice versa, Terraform will perceive this as a need to destroy and recreate all resources, regardless of whether the actual instances have changed. To avoid this, decide on using `count` or `for_each` at the outset and stick to it.  
   
3. **Complex expressions in `count` or `for_each`**: Using complex expressions in `count` or `for_each` can make your code difficult to understand and debug. Try to keep expressions simple or use local values to simplify them.  
   
4. **Zero `count` or empty `for_each`**: If `count` is set to 0 or `for_each` is set to an empty set, no resources will be created. However, Terraform will still evaluate the resource block, and any references to non-existent resources will cause errors. Use conditional expressions to avoid referring to resources that may not exist.  
   
5. **Immutable `count` or `for_each` arguments**: Some resource arguments, like the `name` argument of `azurerm_virtual_machine` in Azure, cannot be updated after creation. If the value of these arguments depends on the `count` or `for_each` index/key, changing the `count` or `for_each` will force Terraform to destroy and recreate the resource. To avoid this, use stable values for these arguments that do not depend on the `count` or `for_each`.  
   
6. **Using `count` and `for_each` together**: Currently, Terraform does not support using `count` and `for_each` in the same resource block. You will need to choose one or the other based on your use case.  
   

## Hands-on Exercise
 
Try to create multiple resources Azure Virtual Networks using both count and for_each loops. Compare the differences and understand when to use which type of loop.
